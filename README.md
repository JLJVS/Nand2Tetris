# Nand2Tetris
Projects for the nand 2 tetris course

# Hardware

## Week 01 - Boolean Logic
This week is focussed on building the fundamental logic gates from NAND gates. These logic gates will form the basis on which later weeks are built.

## Week 02 - Boolean Arithmetic
Based on the logic gates from week 1 we'll build the chips used to perform arithmetic on signals. This consists of designing a Half-Adder, a Full-Adder, Adder, Incrementer and an ALU.
